          <h5>Creating a gateway to the National Archives Catalog</h5>
          <p>At the National Archives, each office has yearly strategic goals to reach. Working at the Office of Innovation, we were tasked to present the archival holdings more clearly and precisely to the public. Leveraging the Catalog API, we decided to focus on presenting each record group with some of their best images. A record group is a way NARA organizes its holdings by agency.</p>

          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>This is a unique project where I worked closely with executive stakeholders and the development team from start to finish. I worked closely with the NARA Chief Innovation Officer, Director of Innovation, and Branch Chief on defining success and features. The following are the key roles I played on the project:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Product Manager</li>
            <li>UX Researcher</li>
            <li>UI Designer</li>
            <li>Data Modeling</li>
            <li>Prototyping</li>
            <li>Accessibility and Quality Checks</li>

          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>The team had three months to complete the project before the next fiscal year started. The project is a key way to show value to the nation and leverage the National Archives catalog API. I designed an intuitive user experience that shows how vast the catalog is and enables the public to explore over 650 record groups.</p>

          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>Leading the discovery phase, I had two major objectives:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Finding the best way to present catalog data visually</li>
            <li>Getting buy-in for a technically viable solution from executive stakeholders</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The research had to show that large amounts of data can be organized in an intuitive way and be production-ready within three months. Using open source projects was key in getting stakeholders and developers on board. Through the use of D3.js, we quickly built a minimally viable product and iterated upon it.</p>

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>The design continues to change through iteration and goal optimization.</p>
          <p>The toolbar allows users to quickly filter down using title search or switching to a table view.</p>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          
          <p>The Strategic Goal for FY2019 was to help users discover at least 3% of the holdings within the catalog. We achieved a staggering victory in providing value to the nation and opening up our collection to more users. We were able to help users discover 84% of the series-level descriptions in a visually appealing way.</p>
